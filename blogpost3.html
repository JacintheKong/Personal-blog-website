                <h3><u>The factors contributing to the box office #3</u></h3>
                <p>1) <u><strong>District</strong></u>. Currently, American movies still have the highest appeal in mainland China, so filmmakers could seize more opportunities to cooperate with American filmmakers and learn from their experience.
                </p>
                <p>2) <u><strong>Budget</strong></u>. Since budget is positively correlated with high box office, film manufacturing companies should be concerned about the amount of investment in the early stages of film production. We could learn from Europe and the United States to broaden the investment channels.
                </p>
                <p>3) <u><strong>Audience expectation</strong></u>. Before the release of the film, investors and producers could release engaging trailers, run advertisements through diverse channels (such as social networking platforms) and hold some press conferences for commercial publicity.
                </p>
                <p>4) <u><strong>Release time</strong></u>. The producers should seize the important festivals to release films, especially China’s Lunar New Year. For instance, the popular film “Lost In Thailand” was shown during the Lunar New Year of 2012 and created a box office miracle of the year.
                </p>
                <p>5) <u><strong>Sequel</strong></u>. The Chinese film investors should learn from experience abroad, make a trade-off between the films’ commercial value and artistic value, and produce sequels for successful films and build domestic film brands.
                </p>
                <p>6) <u><strong>Adaptation/reshoot</strong></u>. before creating scripts and planning to shoot the film, the filmmakers should make sure that the plot of the story or the content of the comic are suitable to be presented by films. Choosing to reshoot famous or popular novels, comics, television works, may have a positive impact on the box office.
                </p>
                <p>7) <u><strong>Gebre</strong></u>. In pursuit of higher boxes, filmmakers could choose to shoot more movies with the popular genre of comedy, action, adventure, drama, romance, sci-fi, and fantasy instead of biography, thriller, and documentary, etc.
                </p>
                <p>8) <u><strong>Directors</strong></u>. In the domestic market, the success of a film’s box office is closely related with its directors. Famous directors like Feng Xiaogang, Zhang Yimou, John Woo, etc. have their personal styles, and filmmakers should consider directors appeal while choosing directors for a film.
