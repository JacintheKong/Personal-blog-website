            <h3><u>The factors contributing to the box office #1</u></h3>

            <p>China has produced a large number of films every year, but the vast majority of the films could not be paralleled with well-regarded films in the international market and the Chinese film market is severely imbalanced. To survive in the market, the Chinese film production company needs to make more efforts to produce high-caliber films and present our traditional culture to other countries. Through research, I hope the following questions (but not confined to them) could be answered:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Which film genre is the most popular among top 100 films?</li>
                <li>Which country has the largest market share in Chinese film market?</li>
                <li>Is the budget directly related with the box office?</li>
                <li>Do popular directors and actors have greater contribution to the box office? </li>
                <li>When is the most appropriate time to release a film?</li>
                <li>Will filmsâ€™ release time difference in different districts exert negative influence on the box office?</li>
                <li>Does sequels and reshoot / adaptation result in higher box office?</li>
                <li>What is the proportion of Chinese films and foreign films in the Chinese film market?</li>
                <li>Does film quality has a positive influence on the box office?</li>
            </ol>
