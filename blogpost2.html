            <h3><u>The factors contributing to the box office #2</u></h3>

            <p>I used the top 100 movie from 2011 to 2015 (altogether 500 movies) as the training set and the top 100 film in 2016 as the validation set. As for methodology, multiple linear regression is employed. The dependent variable (Y) is the box office and the independent variables (X) include whether the film is a sequel, whether it is adaptation/reshoot, audience expectation for the films, directors’ appeal, actors’ appeal, production district, time difference (of releasing the film in mainland China and other areas), release time, genre, film quality (rating), and budget.
            </p>
            <p>The hypothesis is that there is linear relationship between the box office (Y) and other variables (X), and some of the factors will significantly influence films’ box office while others don’t.
            </p>
            <p>Initially I planned to acquire all the data from Kaggle, which are scraped from IMDB. However, I found a problem: the original dataset I got from IMDB involve purely American films, and many variables offered by the dataset are related with facebook likes which are not applicable in China:
                <blockquote cite="https://money.cnn.com/gallery/technology/2016/05/23/banned-china-10/4.html">
                    "Beijing keeps a tight grip on technology and access to media. These 11 items (including facebook) are still off limits."
                </blockquote>
                Therefore, I finally resorted to some Chinese websites.
